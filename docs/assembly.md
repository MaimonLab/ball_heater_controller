## Ball Heater

The ball heater itself is made by wrapping the bottom end of an aluminum ball holder in a layer of kapton tape for insulation, and then a helix of nichrome wire for heating as well as a thermistor for temperature sensing.

### Wiring

The heater is wired using a 4-pin M8 cable as follows :

|Wire Color | Attachment |
| --- | ----|
|Black | Nichrome heater|
|White | Nichrome heater|
|Blue | Thermistor|
|Brown | Thermistor|
